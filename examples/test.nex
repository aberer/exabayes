      [ RUN PARAMETERS ]
      diagFreq 1000		[ check for convergence of multiple independent runs after this many generations ]
      samplingFrequency 50 	[ take a sample every n generations ]
      numIndiChains  4 		[ number of independant chains/runs ]
      numGen 2000000             [ if numIndiChains = 1, stop simulation after that many generations ] 
      tuneFreq 50 		[ tune move parameters every n generations, set to 0, if you want to disable parameter tuning ] 
      printFreq 500		[ print a sample to the screen every n generations, set to 0 if you want to disable output info about the state of the chains  ]

      [ CONVERGENCE ]
      asdsfIgnoreFreq  0.1	[ ignore clades for which the relative  frequency in no chain exceeds this value ]
      asdsfConvergence  0.005    [ indicate convergence, as soon as the asdsf is below this value: 1-5% is considered good, 0.005 can be considered very good convergence ] 


      [ MCMCMC ]
      numCoupledChains 4   [ number of chains per independent run (only one is cold)  => must be > 0] 
      heatFactor 0.1   	   [ the heat increment added to each hotter chain (this is not the inverse heat)   ]
      swapInterval 1 	   [ attempt a swap between chains every n generations ]
      tuneHeat false        [ if true, the heat increment will be tuned, s.t. the cold chain swaps with the coldest hot chain in 23.45% of all cases   ] 

      [ BURNIN ] 
      [ comment out one of the two options ]      
      [ burninGen 2000    [ exact number of generations that are discarded for diagnostics ] ] 
      burninProportion 0.25 [ discard this proportion of all initial samples as burnin  ]

 diagFreq 1000		[ check for convergence of multiple independent runs after this many generations ]
 samplingFrequency 500 	[ take a sample every n generations ]

 parsimonyStartingTree		true		[ allowed values: true  / false(default); if no starting tree is present, a random tree is used   ] 
 heatedChainsUseSame		false		[ should heated chains start with the same tree as the cold chain? default: false] 
 [ sampledHeated false ] [ also take samples from the heated chains ]

 checkPointInterval   1000  [ defines how often a checkpoint is written ]

 [ CONVERGENCE ]
 asdsfIgnoreFreq  0.1	[ ignore clades for which the relative  frequency in no chain exceeds this value ]
 asdsfConvergence  0.005    [ indicate convergence, as soon as the asdsf is below this value: 1-5% is considered good, 0.005 can be considered very good convergence ] 


 [ MCMCMC ]
 numCoupledChains  1	[ number of chains per independent run (only one is cold)  => must be > 0] 
 heatFactor 0.1   	   [ the heat increment added to each hotter chain (this is not the inverse heat)   ]
 swapInterval 1 	   [ attempt a swap between chains every n generations ]
 tuneHeat false        [ if true, the heat increment will be tuned, s.t. the cold chain swaps with the coldest hot chain in 23.45% of all cases   ] 
 
 [ BURNIN ]

 [ burninGen 2000 ]     [ exact number of generations that are discarded for diagnostics ]  
  burninProportion 	  	0.25   	  	[ discard this proportion of all initial samples as burnin  ]

 componentWiseMH false [ enables component-wise Metropolis-Hastings:

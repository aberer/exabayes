First instance of the RAxML-Light based likelihood computation library 

I have commented the main functions top down:

go to axml.c and start with main() 

from there branch off to 

computeBIGRAPID() 

in searchAlgo.c 

Then have a look at the likelihood function implementations
evaluateGenericSpecial.c
newviewGenericSpecial.c
makenewzGeneric.c 

in the above order.
